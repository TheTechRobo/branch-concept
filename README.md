# branch-concept
This is a Branch Concept for repositories.

# The Concept
Basically, you have two main branches: `road` and `driveway`. The `road` branch has the bleeding-edge code that is unfinished and buggy. But it has the latest features. The code in `driveway` is feature-frozen (unless the feature goes through `road` first) but stable. Then you have the typical 1.0.x and 0.2.x etc branches if you want, but the `road` and `driveway` are rolling-release and are always updated.
